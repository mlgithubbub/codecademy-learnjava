# Print Statements

````java
System.out.println("Hello World");
````
- Print statements: output info to the screen, a.k.a. output terminal
- System: built-in java class with useful tools for our programs
- out: short for 'output'
- println: short for 'print line'
- System.out.println(): creates new line on screen after outputting a value

````java
System.out.println("Hello World");
System.out.println("Today is a great day to code!");
/* Output:
    Hello World
    Today is a great day to code! 
 */
````


- System.out.print(): outputs everything on the same line

````java
System.out.print("Hello ");
System.out.print("World");
/* Output:
      Hello World  
 */
````

- println(): cursor is moved to the next line vs. print(): cursor stays on the same line
