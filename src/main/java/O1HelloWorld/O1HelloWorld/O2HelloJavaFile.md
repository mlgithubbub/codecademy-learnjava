# Hello Java File!

- Java files have a .java extension
- Programs can range from one to hundreds of files
- **classes**: are like a single concept, for example: Bicycle, Printer, etc.
- Curly braces {} mark the domain of this concept
- Each java file has one primary class named after it
- The main() method lists the program tasks
- Curly braces {} mark the beginning and ends of methods
- String[] args is a placeholder for info we want to pass into our program

```java
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Morgan!");
    
  }
}
```
